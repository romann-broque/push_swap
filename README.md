## Push Swap

### ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The `Push Swap` project is a sorting algorithm challenge that will put your problem-solving skills to the test. ðŸ§  It's like solving a puzzle with two stacks, and it's oddly satisfying. ðŸ¤¯

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- Sorts a stack of integers efficiently.
- Minimal number of operations.
- Various sorting algorithms to explore.
- A perfect exercise in algorithmic thinking.

### ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Compile the `push_swap` program.
2. Execute it with a list of integers to be sorted.

```shell
./push_swap 3 1 5 2 4
```
